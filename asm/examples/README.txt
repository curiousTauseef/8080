These are some example assembly language programs for the Briel Altair
8800.

The code is written to be assembled using the AS macro assembler. See
http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/index.html

A make file is provided to build the software. You may need to adjust
it for your environment.

While the programs will run standalone (and can even be toggled in
using the front panel switches), you can copy the .HEX file to CP/M,
run LOAD on it to generate a .COM file. and run the COM file. You can
also use DDT to debug it, if desired.
