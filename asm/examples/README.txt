This is a simple machine language monitor program for the Briel Altair
8800.

The code is written to be assembled using the AS macro assembler. See
http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/index.html

A make file is provided to build the software. You may need to adjust
it for your environment.

The program can be loaded in several ways:

1. Toggle in the binary code using the font panel.
2. Load the .BIN file from the SD card.
3. Copy the .HEX file to CP/M, run LOAD on it to generate a .COM file.
   and run the COM file.
