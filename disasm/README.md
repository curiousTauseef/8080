This is a simple disassembler for the Intel 8080 microprocessor. It
reads a binary file specified on the command line and produces a
disassembly. It requires Python 3.3. It has been tested on Linux but
should work on any platform that supports Python. See the source code
for more details.

The file ex1.bin is an example binary file that can be used to test
the disassembler.
